# ðŸ“ŒDisaster Alert

My project Disaster Alert is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to provide users with real-time disaster notifications, whether natural or man-made.

Users can report potential disasters by sharing photo or video evidence within a group chat. This media is automatically analyzed using an integrated machine learning model to verify the authenticity of the event.

Once verified:

âœ…The admin (e.g., a senior disaster response authority , police, Fire Brigade etc) is notified.

âœ…All users are alerted with the exact location of the disaster.

âœ…The affected area is marked as a red zone on an interactive map, helping others stay informed and avoid the danger zone.

âœ…This system enables community-driven, AI-powered disaster detection and response, ensuring faster alerts and improved public safety.
