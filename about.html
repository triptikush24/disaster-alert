            <h2>Disaster Management</h2>
            <p>
                Disaster Management refers to the organization and management of resources and responsibilities for dealing with all aspects of emergencies, including preparedness, response, and recovery. Disasters can be natural (e.g., earthquakes, floods) or man-made (e.g., industrial accidents, terrorism).
            </p>
            <h3>Phases of Disaster Management:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Reduce the impact of disasters through measures like building codes and public awareness.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparedness:</strong> Develop emergency plans, conduct drills, and stock emergency supplies.</li>
                <li><strong>Response:</strong> Provide immediate assistance, rescue operations, and medical aid.</li>
                <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Rebuild infrastructure, provide counseling, and restore normalcy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types of Disasters:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Natural Disasters: Earthquakes, Floods, Hurricanes, Tornadoes, Landslides</li>
                <li>Man-Made Disasters: Industrial Accidents, Terrorism, Nuclear Disasters</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Differences</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Fire Disaster Management</strong> focuses specifically on fire-related emergencies, while <strong>Disaster Management</strong> covers a broader range of natural and man-made disasters. Both require preparedness, quick response, and effective recovery strategies.
